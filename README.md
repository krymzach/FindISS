# Follow ISS

A futuristic 3D website that allows you to follow the International Space Station (ISS) in real time. With the use of models of both the Earth and the ISS from NASA, users can zoom in and out and rotate around the Earth. The user can also focus in on the ISS to see it closer and see where it is over the Earth's surface. The ISS's location is mapped to the location on the Earth where it is in real life.

The ISS moves every 600 frames on the website accurately and you can see specific statistics about the ISS in the top right of the website.

The GitHub Pages demo site can be found [here](https://krymzach.github.io/FollowISS/).
